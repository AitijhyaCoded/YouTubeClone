<h2>YouTube Clone</h2> 
<p>This is a YouTube clone project built only using HTML and CSS. It showcases a similar version of the popular video sharing platform www.youtube.com, demonstrating my skills in front-end development.</p>
<p>The clone features a responsive design, video player, and basic UI elements, all crafted with clean and semantic code.</p> 
<p>Check out the HTML code on the <b>index.html</b> file and refer to the <b>styles-youtube</b> folder for CSS references. The other folders contain all the images used in the code.</p>
